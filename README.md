# TileMap system in C [Raylib rendering]

Built to be as independent system as possible, but for rendering texture and feature (TileMap grid) I choose a Raylib framework.
If using different framework only need to change tileset.h function TileSetDraw.
For example code is used Raylib.

Future plan is to make also an autotiling header.
