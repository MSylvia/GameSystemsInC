# TileMap system in C [Raylib rendering]

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nezvers/TileMap/master/resource/TileMapSystem.gif)

Built to be as independent system as possible, but for rendering texture and feature (TileMap grid) I choose a Raylib framework.
If using different framework only need to change tileset.h function TileSetDraw and tilemap.h function TileMapDrawGrid.
For example code is used Raylib.

Future plan is to make also an autotiling header.
