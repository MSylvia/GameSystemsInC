# Hitbox Collision (WIP)
Single header library for AABB collision detection and resolution.    
Now includes continuous collision (thanks to Javidx9 a.k.a. [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/blob/master/Videos/OneLoneCoder_PGE_Rectangles.cpp))    
To include function implementations (*.c part) `#define HITBOX_COLLISIONS_IMPLEMENTATION` is needed before header inclusion.
