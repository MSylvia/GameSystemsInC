# Viewport scaling
Single header utility for getting rectangles to use for scaling viewport texture (Raylib RenderTexture) to the window.

Library uses struct names NezRect_f and NezVec2_f but you can modify header to rename them with macro, like in Raylib example it is replaced with Rectangle and Vector2. 
To get the function implementation part use `#define VIEWPORT_SCALING_IMPLEMENTATION` before including the header.    
There is an example for Raylib.
